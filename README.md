OldNewResponseModality

This repo contains code for running a recognition memory experiment with multiple response modalities on Matlab Psychtoolbox.  During a study session, subjects learn words through incidental encoding.  During a subsequent test session, subjects make old/new judgments on words using either saccades (eye movements) or manual responses (button pressing).
